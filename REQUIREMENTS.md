## The problem

I love Ubuntu, however I find myself (re)installing the distro multiple times a year. That takes away from precious time that could be spend writing code or spending time with my family

## The solution

I want to automate the whole bang-shoot, I have already created [Nubuntu](https://github.com/calobyte/nubuntu) for debloating, theming and installing the necessary packages I need and [Laravel-Localenv](https://github.com/calobyte/laravel-localenv) that I use to setup some basic VS Code extensions as well as install `php`, `composer` and `laravel` as well as `nvm`, `node` and `npm`. So I am pretty much there...

## What more do I need?

- [x] More VS Code extensions
    - [x] spellchecker
    - [x] Error lens
    - [x] prettier
- [x] A SSH key pair
- [ ] Some additional applications
    - [x] VirtualBox
    - [x] Tilix (a better terminal)
         [ ] Fix error on launch
    - [x] Localsend
    - [x] Bruno (REST Client)
    - [ ] Something to sign PDF's with
    - [x] Basic office suite (Probably libre office)
    - [x] OBS
    - [x] GIMP
    - [ ] Some sort of vector graphics editor (inkscape?)
    - [ ] Video editor (kdenlive? or better maybe resolve)
    - [ ] Ollama (sigh...)
    - [x] Cura for 3D slicing
    - [x] Remove desktop software (remmina)

There are quite a few applications on this list, and I probably have not exhausted the requirements, however I think this is a great start!
